Q. Why are there more statistics in forward rapidity if we make pT cuts higher for the photons in calibration code?
Because with higher pT cuts you are asking photons to be more energetic and higher transverse momentum which means these types of photons are mainly found in the very forward (also backward) rapidity instead of the mid-rapidity. Mid-rapidity photons are mainly not so much energetic and momenta. So, if you lower the pT cuts, then you are now trying to accumulate as much of photons possibly even from the mid-rapidity regions.
